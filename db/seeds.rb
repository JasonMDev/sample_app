# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rake db:seed (or created alongside the db with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   cities = City.create([{ name: 'Chicago' }, { name: 'Copenhagen' }])
#   Mayor.create(name: 'Emanuel', city: cities.first)

# The code creates an example user with name and email address replicating our 
# previous one, and then makes 99 more.
# The create! method is just like the create method, except it raises an 
# exception for an invalid user rather than returning false.  This behavior 
# makes debugging easier by avoiding silent errors.
# Run the following to reset database and invoke rake task:
# $ bundle exec rake db:migrate:reset
# $ bundle exec rake db:seed

User.create!(name:  "Example User",
             email: "example@railstutorial.org",
             password:              "foobar",
             password_confirmation: "foobar",
             admin: true,
             activated: true,
             activated_at: Time.zone.now)

99.times do |n|
  name  = Faker::Name.name
